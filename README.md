Sundial Travel Blog: Where Women Travelers Connect!!!!
----
In this application, I created a social media blogging website for solo women travelers who want to share their stories and experiences. 

This respository is the back-end application, while the following link is the front-end api application: https://github.com/Kerah-Jones/Travel-Blog-Client. 

Both application were created from scratch. This is phase one of this application which give the users the opportunity to create a blog and post it to the board for others to view, however, only the owner of that post can update and delete. Users are also about to write a review/comment for a blog post. Phase two will consist of the ability to ,update review, delete review, and like a post. 
This is the link to my live site https://kerah-jones.github.io/Travel-Blog-Client.

I had a great time building the back-end of this application. 
I knew in my user models I wanted the api to recongnize the user by the email and password, and I also wanted to give the ability to change password.
I also wanted my blog model to hold a title and post, but most importantly I wanted it to only allow the owner of the blog to be able to update or delete post. 
In my review model, I wanted the review to be connected  to a owner as well, but have the capabilities to post on other blogs (feature of update and delete review comming soon).
All of the blog post, no matter which account you are signed in under, you are able to view blogs from other users and comment/review them. 
Once all of these elements were set in place for my api, I was able to move onto my front-end application with a solid foundation. I struggled with the routes of my models, and some that were broken, I did not realize until I got to the front-end of my application and had to back track to my back-end. Therefore, when I thought I was finished with my back-end, I actually was not. However, I was able to find the bugs and fix them in which resulted in me successfully completing this application.

There are a few feature I still would like to add in phase two of my application, there are always ways to make it better. Will continue to commit and push new code to this application (hint: delete and update review)
